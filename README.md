# bloons-odyssey-macro

Python script that uses pyautogui to play the Bloons TD6 odyssey multiple times because theres an achievement to do 100 and they take like 30 minutes each

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ydnamjs/bloons-odyssey-macro.git`
2. Navigate into the repository: `cd bloons-odyssey-macro/`
3. Launch Bloons TD 6
4. Enter the main menu screen
5. Run: `python main.py`
6. Set Bloons TD6 as the focused window
7. Wait for the program to finish running

## Technologies Used
- python 3
- pyautoGUI

## Demo-Video
TODO: I have a demo video that I'll upload at some point if I can find it and edit it down to a single run

## Limitations
Note that this will not work on your machine because the odyssey game mode changes every week and this script is not intelligent

Further more the script is resolution dependent so even if you are doing the same odyssey you need to do it in full screen 1600 x 900
